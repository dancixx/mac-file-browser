# Mac Finder 

A blazing fast file finder for Mac written in Rust ðŸ¦€. The purpose of this project is to make my knowledge of Rust better and to learn more about the Rust ecosystem and I really hate the default finder on Mac. The project is still in development and is not ready for use only for testing purposes.
